Scratched the whole thing, had two buttons "rest" and "board resize" but the resize button was not working and started messing with stuff and then got frustrated
so I deleted everything.  Ending up recreating the board and the reset function works with resize feature.  

Tomorrow:
Work on aesthitic and figure out how to center and make a square.  Do some research on grid-row-template and how the grid is actually set up.
